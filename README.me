# IDEAS:
- TODO: Add way to have "Requirements" in the resources section of info files. Like ```{ "resource": "Britomal", "modifier": 0, "requirement": "mining" }```. This lets me restrict access to resources until requirements are met. Another way is to simply use seperate contract lists. I could test out both ways.
- TODO: Create a function that checks for misspellings, by gathering all of a class's names and then finding examples of misspellings.
- TODO: Create a function that crosses the locations and contracts and finds the resources and weights that are more and less common, resources that are exclusive to locations, so I can better balance the game.
