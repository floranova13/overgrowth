Named by Hale shortly after taking his position heading up the Commerce Division, the Homewell Blossom is much like the Mellowend in how common and ordinary it is. Yet unlike the Mellowend, it does not grow beyond the wilderness territory local to Seras. Stories have spread about the Flourishflora. That it brings luck where it is grown, that each of its three petals represents an element of the Trine. It has also come to symbolize the accumulation of goodwill. Hale did not make traditional profit from the sale of these plants, but he used them to establish a network of contacts with which to do future business. This is how an otherwise-unremarkable species became worth something in local markets."

        "Description": "Often mislabelled by inexperienced Seekers as a creeping plant or even an aquatic tangle, Bogbind is a Flourishflora that also happens to be a creeping plant which also happens to live partially within the waters of the bogs in which it grows. The Flourishflora classification supercedes any other categorical systems. What makes proper identification even more difficult is it's tendency to strangle and “devour” immobilized intruding fauna. It determines what is an intruder in its territory using one of two “threat identification” behavioral patterns. Aggressive variants will immedietely mark foreign organisms as threts, while reactionary variants will only do so once it determines that the lives of the organisms it watches over have been harmed. The Flourishflora does not attack itself, though. Instead, it sprays a harmless scent marker onto targets and waits for the denizens of its bog, be they flora, fauna, or fungi, to incapacitate the threat. Once incapacitated, the Bogbind grows special roots into the threat and begins draining it of life. It spreads nutrients to the organisms that participated in the incapacitation, identifying them by a second marking scent that it sprays on them in the heat of the struggle. It uses these methods to manage its territory, but it does no more. If the nutrient-bestowed victors are beset by would-be predators, they must defend their spoils alone."

Without knowledge of what the illness was and no general-use medical technology on hand, a former Seeker suggested distilling a curative from this Flower, despite having yet been encountered and studied. The former Seeker's suggestion was based on how similar it was to another species of Flower that possessed restorative properties. Other indications suggested it could also be poisonous, and the Seeker warned Evele that it could make the illness worse. Running out of time before the opposing army would make its move, Evele makes the gamble and successfully recovers. So quick was the Commander's recovery, and so decisive was the subsequent victory, that they gained a reputation for being 'unkillable'. Evele protested this label, crediting the former Seeker's insight, but the rumors persisted."

Like the related species, from which it gets its name, this flourishflora recedes during daylight hours and then unfurls in the dark of night to temporarily bloom and spread Vira it has produced during its hibernation. Nightray Coloris blooms are witnessed by only the most fortunate Seekers, the luckiest of whom gathering living specimens to grow or sell. What sets the Nightray Coloris apart from the Nightray is the color of the  flourishflora's blooms. The color changes as a result of numerous factors, most unknown to even the most intelligent Seeker scholars, in part due to its rarity. Seekers have a special nickname for this plant, the 'Night Princess Flower'. It is derived from a peculiar case where an ancient Seeker was discovered to be a member of royalty only after rising in the ranks from recruit to leader in her Seeker Branch. She had told no one of her lineage, relying on skill and charisma to fuel her success. Multiple conflicting stories speak of the reason for her deception, but the only clear tale tells of the revelation of her bloodline. Upon discovering a Nightray Coloris specimen and successfully harvesting it, her fame grew  to the point where a member of her family recognized her likeness on a portrait commissioned by adoring members of her Seeker Branch to memorialize her harvest. Her beauty was said to be comparable to that of the flourishflora itself. Not wishing to put her Seekers in the middle of a royal scandal, the princess resigned her position and disappeared as mysteriously as she had arrived."
