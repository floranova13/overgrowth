# OVERGROWTH

## **IDEAS:**
- TODO: Add way to have "Requirements" in the resources section of info files. Like ```{ "resource": "Britomal", "modifier": 0, "requirement": "mining" }```. This lets me restrict access to resources until requirements are met. Another way is to simply use seperate contract lists. I could test out both ways.
- TODO: Create a function that crosses the locations and contracts and finds the resources and weights that are more and less common, resources that are exclusive to locations, so I can better balance the game.
- TODO: Add the ability to have descriptions parsed with spoilers. Descriptions would be split based on unlock conditions.
- TODO: Possibly add the option to sift rock for minerals, or, rather, mine rock and have a chance of the mineral appearing. The chances are in the file on geological materials.
- TODO: Possibly have an Engineering division addon. The Seekers go out and find possible mining locations. The Guardian Division then defends these locations while the miners setup a mining operation.
